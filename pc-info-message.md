ATX Hack for Change project champions,

We’re excited to have you as a project champion at this year’s ATX Hack for Change! 

This message contains information on how we’re going to run project pitches on Saturday morning 6/4, as well as an information about our [ATX Hack for Change Slack organization](http://atxhack4change.slack.com/) for online communication leading up to and during the event. 

## 1. Get ready for your project pitch on Saturday morning, June 4.

As you get ready to pitch your project, here are some [suggestions](https://github.com/atxhack4change/2016-project-proposals#once-your-project-is-accepted-here-are-some-things-we-suggest-you-do-next) about setting up a GitHub repo and fleshing out your project. 

Project pitches will take place on **Saturday, June 4, at 9:00 AM at the St. Edwards University Alumni Gym**.  

Here’s how the pitching will work:
- **Timing:** Each project champion will get 60 seconds (1 minute) to pitch their idea.
- **Format:** Project champions will grab the mic and pitch their project from the Alumni Gym stage. 
- **Pitching Order:** [The order in which the projects will pitch is linked here.](https://github.com/atxhack4change/2016-project-proposals/blob/master/Project Pitch Schedule.pdf)
- **Visuals:** We will have a default slide for each project with the project title, project champion name, and Slack channel. Additionally, you may also provide one visual (that can fit on a powerpoint slide) during your pitch. 

### If you want to use one visual during your pitch, send it to innovation@austintexas.gov no later than Wednesday, June 1st, at 10:00 PM.

Attendees will form teams immediately following the project pitches. We’ll invite hackers to come talk to the project champions and join whichever team they’re interested in. We’ve also set up Slack channels for each project (details below), so attendees can join the channels for the projects they’re interested in.

## 2. Join our Slack team and take the reins of your project’s Slack channel.
 
We’ve sent all hackathon registrants an invitation to join our Slack team. Slack is an easy-to-use team messaging application that we’ll use to manage communication within teams and among participants during the hackathon. We [event staff] will use it to blast out skill needs (“Project XYZ needs a WordPress guru”) and important announcements (“Lunch is served!”) as well. If you’re not familiar with Slack, [check it out here](https://slack.com/). 

We’ve also set up a Slack channel for each project for you to use to manage and message your team. We’ve left a comment on your Github submission with the name of your project’s slack channel.

If you haven't received an invitation to join the slack organization, let us know and we help get you set up.

## 3. Mark your calendar for the ATX Hack for Change [kickoff reception and keynote speakers](http://atxhackforchange.org/attend.html) on Friday June 3, at 5:00 PM at the Alumni Gym.  

If you have further questions, please reach out to the following emails and we'll get back to you as soon as possible:
